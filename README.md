# AWildMadLibsGame

This is a small conversion of the madlibs game project found on codecademy. To practice creating classes and methods I seperated all of the user inputs into seperate classes.
There is fx a class called contries with a method to return n number of contries as a list of strings, from a list contained in the class. So fx the list has 12 countries
and you can ask the class to return 3 randomly selected countries from that list.

This way the program generates it's own silly stories, independent of user input. I had a bit of fun with and got to practice classes and method calls...
